# ðŸ“š INEP Microdata Analysis

INEP provides [microdata](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos/microdados/enem) from the Brazilian ENEM test, which contains information about participants, such as age, gender and income, as well as the result obtained in the test. In this project, my goal was to analyze the data from the last year released (2021) of the ENEM test through the Python language.

The analysis was divided into three steps:

ðŸ”¹ [Data preparation](https://github.com/marianamannes/inep-microdata-analysis/blob/main/analysis/data-preparation.ipynb): cleaning the dataset to make further analyzes easier and remove possible problems from the dataset, such as incorrect or incomplete data.

ðŸ”¹ [Data visualization](https://github.com/marianamannes/inep-microdata-analysis/blob/main/analysis/data-visualization.ipynb): exploratory data analysis through visual methods.

ðŸ”¹ [Hypothesis testing](https://github.com/marianamannes/inep-microdata-analysis/blob/main/analysis/hypothesis-testing.ipynb): checking if the differences noticed by data visualization were statistically significant.
