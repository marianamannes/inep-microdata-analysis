# INEP Microdata Analysis

INEP provides [microdata](https://www.gov.br/inep/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/dados-abertos/microdados/enem) from the Brazilian ENEM test, which contains information about participants, such as age, gender and income, as well as the result obtained in the test. In this project, I had the purpose of analyzing the data from the last year released (2021) of the ENEM test through the Python language.

The analysis was divided into three steps:

ðŸ”¹ Date preparation: cleaning the dataset to make further analyzes easier and remove possible problems from the dataset, such as incorrect or incomplete data.

ðŸ”¹ Data visualization: exploratory data analysis through visual methods.

ðŸ”¹ Hypothesis testing: checking if the differences noticed by data visualization are statistically significant.
